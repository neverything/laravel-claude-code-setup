The installer intelligently sets up global servers once and adds project-specific servers for each Laravel project.

## 🚀 Quick Install

### Option 1: Direct Installation (Recommended)

Run this single command from your Laravel project root:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laraben/laravel-claude-code-setup/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Option 2: With Tokens Pre-configured

If you want to skip the interactive prompts:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_personal_access_token"
export FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_figma_access_token"
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laraben/laravel-claude-code-setup/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Option 3: Download and Run

For more control or if you prefer to review the script first:

```bash
# Download the script
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laraben/laravel-claude-code-setup/main/install.sh -o setup.sh

# Make it executable
chmod +x setup.sh

# Run it
./setup.sh
```

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running the installer, make sure you have:

1. **Claude Code** installed ([Download here](https://claude.ai/code))
2. **Node.js & npm** installed
3. **Go 1.22+** installed (for database MCP server)
4. **A Laravel project** with `.env` file configured
5. **GitHub Personal Access Token** (the installer will guide you)
6. **Figma Personal Access Token** (optional, for design integration)

## 🔑 Token Setup

### GitHub Token Setup

You'll need a GitHub Personal Access Token for private repository access:

1. Go to [GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select these scopes:
   - ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - ✅ `read:user` (Read user profile data)
   - ✅ `user:email` (Access user email addresses)
4. Copy the generated token when prompted by the installer

### 🎨 Figma Token Setup (Optional)

For design-to-code workflows:

1. Go to [Figma Settings → Personal access tokens](https://www.figma.com/settings/account)
2. Click "Create new token"
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Claude Code MCP")
4. Copy the generated token when prompted by the installer

## 🎮 Usage After Installation

Once installed, just open Claude Code in your Laravel project:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/laravel/project
claude
```

Then test everything works:

### 📊 Database & Project Analysis
- "Show me the database structure"
- "What Laravel version is this project using?"
- "Read my .env file and suggest optimizations"

### 🐙 GitHub Integration
- "List recent commits from my private GitHub repo"
- "Show me open pull requests"
- "What's the current branch status?"

### 🎨 Figma Design Integration
- "Analyze this Figma design: https://www.figma.com/design/ABC123/MyProject"
- "Convert this Figma button component to a Livewire component"
- "Extract the color palette from this Figma file for Tailwind CSS"

### 🧠 Memory & Learning
- "Remember that we use Filament for admin panels"
- "What coding standards do we follow in this project?"
- "What decisions have we made about the authentication system?"

### 🔧 Development Shortcuts
```bash
# Load helpful aliases
source .claude/shortcuts.sh

# Quick commands
pa migrate              # php artisan migrate
make-livewire Button   # php artisan make:livewire Button
serve                  # php artisan serve
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Interactive Mode Not Working?

If you're running via `curl | bash` and the interactive prompts aren't working:

```bash
# Download and run directly for interactive mode
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laraben/laravel-claude-code-setup/main/install.sh -o setup.sh
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### GitHub Private Repository Access Issues?

The installer should configure this automatically. If you still can't access private repos:

1. Check if your token is configured:
```bash
claude mcp list
```

2. Manually update the token in your Claude config:
```bash
# Edit the config file
nano ~/.claude.json

# Add your token to the GitHub MCP server configuration
```

### Figma Integration Not Working?

1. Verify your Figma token is valid
2. Check that the file you're trying to access is not private (unless you have access)
3. Use the full Figma URL format: `https://www.figma.com/design/FILE_KEY/File-Name`

### Database Connection Failed?

Make sure your Laravel `.env` file has valid database credentials before running the installer.

### Missing Dependencies?

The installer will tell you what's missing, but you can check manually:
```bash
# Check Claude Code
claude --version

# Check Node.js
node --version

# Check Go
go version

# Check npm
npm --version
```
