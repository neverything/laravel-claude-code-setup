# ðŸš€ AGENT-ORCHESTRATED IMPLEMENTATION

## Phase 1: Research (Parallel)
```
I'll spawn research agents to explore the codebase:
- Agent 1: Analyze existing patterns
- Agent 2: Map dependencies
- Agent 3: Review similar implementations
```
*Reference: `.claude/agents/research-agent.md`*

## Phase 2: Planning
After research, I'll create a detailed implementation plan and verify with you.

<ultrathink-available>
For complex architecture: "Let me ultrathink about this solution"
</ultrathink-available>

## Phase 3: Implementation (Parallel)
```
I'll spawn specialized agents:
- Implementation agent: Build the feature
- Test agent: Write tests simultaneously
```
*References: `.claude/agents/implementation-agent.md`, `.claude/agents/test-agent.md`*

## Phase 4: Quality Assurance
```
I'll spawn agents for quality:
- Fix agent: Resolve any issues
- Review agent: Final validation
```
*References: `.claude/agents/fix-agent.md`, `.claude/agents/review-agent.md`*
</orchestrated-workflow>

<quality-gates>
## Automatic Quality Gates

Hooks will verify at each step:
- After each file edit â†’ Linting check
- After implementation â†’ Test execution
- Before completion â†’ Full validation

**If hooks fail**: Fix agents spawn automatically
</quality-gates>

<rule-compliance>
## Standards Enforcement

All implementations follow:
- `.claude/rules/laravel-standards.json`
- `.claude/rules/forbidden-patterns.json`
- `.claude/rules/quality-checks.json`

Key requirements:
- Delete old code when replacing
- No TODOs or temporary solutions
- Complete implementation only
</rule-compliance>

<completion-criteria>
## Success Metrics

âœ… Research complete - patterns understood
âœ… Plan approved - approach validated
âœ… Implementation working - feature functional
âœ… Tests passing - coverage achieved
âœ… All checks green - quality assured
âœ… Code reviewed - production ready
</completion-criteria>
