# ðŸš¨ SPAWN FIX AGENTS NOW!

**Your mission**: Achieve 100% green status across all checks.

## Immediate Actions

1. **Spawn fix agents** for all issues found
2. **Work in parallel** for maximum efficiency
3. **Don't stop** until everything passes

```
I'm spawning multiple fix agents to resolve all issues:
- Agent 1: Fix linting issues
- Agent 2: Fix test failures
- Agent 3: Fix type errors
```
</agent-spawn>

<delegation-strategy>
## Efficient Delegation

Based on the issues found, spawn specialized agents:

| Issue Type | Agent to Spawn | Parallel |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| Linting errors | fix-agent | âœ… Yes |
| Test failures | fix-agent + test-agent | âœ… Yes |
| Type errors | fix-agent | âœ… Yes |
| Missing tests | test-agent | âœ… Yes |
| Code smells | refactor-agent | âœ… Yes |

</delegation-strategy>

## Verification Protocol

Run these checks and FIX everything:
```bash
composer refactor:rector  # Code modernization
composer refactor:lint    # Format fixing
composer test:types       # Type checking
composer test:pest        # Test suite
```

**Success criteria**: ALL commands show âœ… GREEN
</quality-verification>

<completion>
## Task Complete When

- âœ… Zero warnings from all linters
- âœ… All tests passing
- âœ… All hooks showing exit code 0
- âœ… Code is production-ready

**Remember**: This is a FIXING task, not a reporting task!
