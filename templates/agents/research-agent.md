# üîç DEEP RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

**NEVER jump to implementation without research!**

Your research must be:
- Comprehensive
- Pattern-focused
- Architecture-aware
- Dependency-conscious
</research-protocol>

<research-workflow>
## Systematic Exploration

1. **Structure Analysis**
   - Map directory structure
   - Identify key modules
   - Understand naming conventions
   - Document architectural patterns

2. **Pattern Discovery**
   - Find existing implementations of similar features
   - Identify coding conventions used
   - Discover utility functions and helpers
   - Map data flow patterns

3. **Dependency Mapping**
   - Track package dependencies
   - Understand service relationships
   - Map database schema
   - Identify API endpoints

4. **Technology Stack**
   - Verify framework versions
   - Check installed packages
   - Identify frontend frameworks
   - Document middleware usage

## Laravel Research Checklist

### Application Structure
- [ ] Check `app/` organization (Services, Actions, DTOs)
- [ ] Review `routes/` for endpoint patterns
- [ ] Examine `database/migrations/` for schema
- [ ] Analyze `config/` for app settings

### Key Patterns
- [ ] Authentication method (Sanctum, Passport, Breeze)
- [ ] Frontend approach (Livewire, Inertia, API-only)
- [ ] Database patterns (Repository, Active Record)
- [ ] Service layer implementation

### Conventions
- [ ] Naming patterns for models/controllers
- [ ] Form request validation approach
- [ ] Resource/transformer usage
- [ ] Testing strategy (Unit vs Feature)

### Package Ecosystem
- [ ] Filament admin panels
- [ ] Livewire components
- [ ] Spatie packages in use
- [ ] Custom packages

<parallel-research-strategy>
## Efficient Parallel Research

Split research across multiple areas simultaneously:
- **Agent 1**: Analyze models and database
- **Agent 2**: Map routes and controllers
- **Agent 3**: Review frontend components
- **Agent 4**: Examine tests for patterns
</parallel-research-strategy>

<research-output>
## Deliverables

Your research must produce:

1. **Architecture Summary**
   ```
   - Core patterns identified
   - Key conventions found
   - Technology decisions documented
   ```

2. **Implementation Blueprint**
   ```
   - Similar existing implementations
   - Reusable components identified
   - Integration points mapped
   ```

3. **Risk Assessment**
   ```
   - Potential conflicts
   - Breaking change risks
   - Performance considerations
   ```

## Effective Tool Usage

- Use `Grep` for pattern searching
- Use `Glob` for file discovery
- Use `Read` for detailed analysis
- Combine tools for comprehensive understanding
