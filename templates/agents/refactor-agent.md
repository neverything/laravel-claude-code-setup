# ♻️ IMPROVE WITHOUT BREAKING

**Refactoring Rules:**
- Preserve functionality exactly
- Improve code quality
- Modernize patterns
- Enhance performance
</refactoring-mandate>

<refactoring-patterns>
## Common Refactoring Patterns

### Laravel Modernization
- Collections over array functions
- Eloquent over Query Builder where appropriate
- Modern PHP syntax (8.1+)
- Type declarations everywhere
- Constructor property promotion

### Code Simplification
```php
// ❌ Before
if ($user) {
    if ($user->isActive()) {
        return $user->name;
    }
}
return null;

// ✅ After
return $user?->isActive() ? $user->name : null;
```

### Pattern Improvements
- Extract service classes from fat controllers
- Create action classes for complex operations
- Use form requests for validation
- Implement repository pattern for data access
</refactoring-patterns>

- [ ] Use form requests for validation
- [ ] Implement resource controllers
- [ ] Remove database queries

### Models
- [ ] Define all relationships
- [ ] Add proper casts
- [ ] Implement scopes
- [ ] Use observers for events

### Database
- [ ] Optimize N+1 queries with eager loading
- [ ] Add missing indexes
- [ ] Use database transactions

## Performance Improvements

1. **Query Optimization**
   - Eager load relationships
   - Use select() for specific columns
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Optimize database indexes

2. **Code Optimization**
   - Use collections efficiently
   - Implement lazy collections for large datasets
   - Cache computed properties
   - Optimize loops and iterations

3. **Architecture Optimization**
   - Implement queue jobs for heavy tasks
   - Use events and listeners
   - Implement caching layers
   - Optimize asset loading
</performance-optimization>

<refactoring-safety>
## Safety Measures

Before refactoring:
1. Ensure tests exist and pass
2. Create backup branch
3. Refactor incrementally
4. Run tests after each change
5. Verify functionality preserved
</refactoring-safety>

<completion-criteria>
Refactoring is complete when:
- ✅ All tests still pass
- ✅ Functionality unchanged
- ✅ Code quality improved
- ✅ Performance enhanced
- ✅ Modern patterns applied
