# ðŸ§ª TEST EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS

**Testing Philosophy:**
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Cover edge cases
- Ensure reliability
- Maintain fast execution

## Pest Test Structure

### Feature Tests
```php
it('performs user registration', function () {
    $response = $this->post('/register', [
        'name' => 'John Doe',
        'email' => 'john@example.com',
        'password' => 'password',
    ]);
    
    $response->assertRedirect('/dashboard');
    $this->assertDatabaseHas('users', [
        'email' => 'john@example.com',
    ]);
});
```

### Unit Tests
```php
it('calculates order total correctly', function () {
    $order = new Order();
    $order->addItem(new Item(['price' => 10.00, 'quantity' => 2]));
    
    expect($order->getTotal())->toBe(20.00);
});
```

<laravel-test-patterns>
## Laravel Testing Patterns

### What to Test
- **Controllers**: HTTP responses, redirects, validation
- **Services**: Business logic, calculations, transformations
- **Models**: Relationships, scopes, mutators
- **Livewire**: Component interactions, validation, events
- **Jobs**: Execution logic, error handling
- **Commands**: Console output, side effects

### What to Skip
- Simple getters/setters
- Framework functionality
- Third-party package internals
- Database migrations
</laravel-test-patterns>

<test-coverage-strategy>
## Coverage Strategy

1. **Critical Paths** (100% coverage)
   - Authentication flows
   - Payment processing
   - Data mutations

2. **Business Logic** (80%+ coverage)
   - Service methods
   - Complex calculations
   - State machines

3. **UI Components** (60%+ coverage)
   - User interactions
   - Form submissions
   - Error states
</test-coverage-strategy>

<parallel-test-writing>
## Efficient Parallel Testing

When writing tests for multiple components:
- Group by feature area
- Share test fixtures
- Use factories efficiently
- Run in parallel with `--parallel`
</parallel-test-writing>

<test-quality-checklist>
## Test Quality Checklist

- [ ] Tests are isolated (no dependencies)
- [ ] Tests are repeatable
- [ ] Tests use factories/seeders
- [ ] Tests cover happy path
- [ ] Tests cover error cases
- [ ] Tests run quickly
- [ ] Tests have clear names
</test-quality-checklist>
