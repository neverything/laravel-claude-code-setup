## Common Issues to Catch

### Performance Issues
```php
// ‚ùå N+1 Query Problem
$users = User::all();
foreach ($users as $user) {
    echo $user->posts->count();
}

// ‚úÖ Eager Loading
$users = User::withCount('posts')->get();
foreach ($users as $user) {
    echo $user->posts_count;
}
```

### Security Issues
```php
// ‚ùå SQL Injection Risk
DB::select("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '$email'");

// ‚úÖ Parameterized Query
User::where('email', $email)->first();
```

### Maintainability Issues
```php
// ‚ùå Magic Numbers
if ($user->age > 17) { }

// ‚úÖ Named Constants
if ($user->age > User::MINIMUM_AGE) { }
```
</common-issues>
